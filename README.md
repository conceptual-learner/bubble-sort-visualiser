# bubble-sort-visualiser
The sorting visualiser was created because I was fascinated by bubble sort algorithm and I wanted to visualise how it works. Even though the time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n2)and the space complexity for Bubble Sort is O(1) . The main advantage of Bubble Sort is the simplicity of the algorithm. This project was created using C# in visual studio.
